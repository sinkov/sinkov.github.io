Abstract Since the emergence of AI and the recent increase in computational power of machines, the healthcare industry has quickly become one of the most forward-thinking fields of application. This work is intended to help the Rolls-Royce initiative in developing an assistive technology device for Motor Neuron Disease patients. This paper compares different Natural Language Processing and machine learning techniques for predicting the category of a user&amp;rsquo;s question using a publicly available dataset - Yahoo Answers, which contains ten categories and 1,4 million rows.</description>

      <description>üìÇ Github Repo has the corresponding Jupyter notebook and beautiful report üòã.
Assignment description The final course project (FCP) consists of a text classification task: you‚Äôre supposed to adjudicate between helpful and unhelpful movie reviews from the IMDB database. For the sake of redundancy, your goal is to classify each movie review ‚Äúi‚Äù into one of the two categories: 0/not helpful: less than 30% of IMDB users found movie review ‚Äúi‚Äù helpful 1/helpful: more than 70% of IMDB users found movie review ‚Äúi‚Äù helpful</description>

Assignment description For the final course project (fcp), you will handle a real-world dataset. In particular, you are required to store, manipulate, and analyze GitHub data for PyTorch and Tensorflow. Both projects are examples of open source software (OSS) development. OSS challenges common managerial assumptions on the organizing and func- tioning of organizations (Gulati et al., 2012), attracting the interest of research enthusiasts from several disciplines (e.</description>

Sensors data per second: Sensor 1 Sensor 2 Confusion marices visualization Task description Create a recurrent neural network in TensorFlow to predict the operating mode of a wind turbine based on the two time series from the sensors. Before any implementation, carefully consider what type of approach (sequence-to-vector, sequence-to-sequence, or encoder-decoder) is most sensible here and how you need to manipulate the data, given that you have two different time series for each observation.</description>

Background The compound of technologies we use to call &amp;lsquo;AI&amp;rsquo; promises to revolutionize many sectors. However, there is a substantial gap between what firms say they do with AI and what they actually do with it [1]. Several factors could account for such a gap: the adoption of AI tools is costly since it tends to jeopardize an incumbent&amp;rsquo;s operations [2]; there is a shortage of human capital trained in the area of AI [3]; developing AI applcations may require businesses to cope with ethical/societal implications [4, 5] and regulatory issues [6].</description>

      <description>1. Introduction to this group project (Github link)
This project sought to analyse a proportion of the actor network embedded in the American film industry. Data used in the network analysis was scraped from a list on IMDb titled ‚Äò 500 Top-Rated Features Since 2000‚Äô. The scope of this project includes only US movies released between 2000 and 2012, and the 10 main actors from each film. The Hollywood movie industry is characterized by short-term relationships based on collaboration.</description>
