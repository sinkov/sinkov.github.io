I know why data is the new oil. For me, it is more than just a bunch of buzzwords."

Making informed decisions, having alternative solutions to each problem, possesing reliable data – were the key factors of the well-being of an enterprise, based on my professional experience. 

I graduated from one of Europe's most comprehensive [programmes](https://logistics.hse.ru/en/) in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, where I got my hands dirty by gaining experience in the department of innovations at the national railway operator and conducting research of the supply chain of a large frozen food [producer](https://sh2000.ru/en/). 

Upon graduation, I worked in a variety of roles and industries, including hospitality (short-term [project](https://kaprizissykkul.kg/en/)), oil and gas [construction](https://www.shell.com/about-us/major-projects/sakhalin/sakhalin-an-overview.html) (3 years), food [retail](https://www.x5.ru/en/) (1 year), and real estate development (short-term [project](https://www.the-village.ru/business/how/colife?from=infinite_scroll)). 

I realized that data-related issues were the root cause of the majority of managerial issues. Many millions of dollars could be saved during transportation to the construction site and purchasing, more satisfied customers could be served, manufacturing costs could be significantly optimized, and inventory levels – reduced. Many hours of non-value-added work could be simply eliminated.
